# Easier Data-Editor
**A data editor in 2020!**

This project is a data editor for the game Little Fighter 2. It is the Notepad++ in the LF2 universe.


## Libraries
The project uses two main libraries for more user friendliness.
* [DockPanel Suite](https://github.com/dockpanelsuite/dockpanelsuite)
* [ScintillaNET](https://github.com/jacobslusser/ScintillaNET)


## Remark
This was my first git repository. So there a lot of things which are bad, like: 
* no releases
* no using of issues board
* all commits to the master branch
* bad documentation (no "first repo" problem)
* ...

Furthermore, I have my own git server and this repo is not a mirror. I want separate this repo with my repo on my server because I don't want check on each commit if there any personal things in the code.
Sometimes I have an absolute path in my code to load or save something (DEBUG). In this case it is possible that the path contains my real name or information about my directory structure etc. These things I want "to hide" from the public.
